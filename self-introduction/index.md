Hello, sorry for the poor quality. My name is Aleksander and I`m learning Front-end.

I'm 31 years old. I have a finance degree, but have never worked in a profession.
I ended up working first as an estimator, then as a designer of fire alarm systems.
But in 2022 I had to change my residence and was without a full-time job, only doing
custom projects from time to time.

I wrote my first html tag when I was a student, but in those days the interest
in it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.

Then, when I was already working, there was a desire to try to write code.
Because of the frontend there is no need to install any third-party applications, compilers,
etc., so it was decided to try the frontend.
I found a free online course from HTML academy and got basic knowledge in html, css, js.
and in my free time, I've been trying to design one-page lendings.
At the time, I hadn't seriously considered starting a career in IT.

But some global events changed my life. And i decided that if it happend,
why not to try continue to study web dev. and in the future going to make this my main job.

After 2022 yaer, I studied php for a while to layout pages on bootstrap. I tried to learn React and
Redux, typescript.
In general unstructured tried to study what seemed to me necessary for the frontend until
accidentally found RSSchool.

All projects finalized are assignments from RSSchool. Deadlines and points motivate you to finish them.
I am not fast in life and I think that I write code slowly, I can think for a long time how to realize
some functionality or solve a problem. It takes a lot of time, so there is not enough time to improve
theoretical knowledge, and this affects the speed of code writing. It's a vicious circle

Briefly about myself. I think that i average human. I like holiday and I love to work for good money.
